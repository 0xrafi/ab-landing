            It all started in August of 2017. Aditya and Brinda added to the storied history of on-set romances by
            playing brother and sister on the set of Breakfast in Bangalore. Despite both sharing NYU as an alma mater
            and living three miles away from one another on the east side of New York City (represent!), their paths
            never crossed until Adit first laid eyes on Brinda - and no he wasn’t in character at the time! <br></br><br></br>

            It was love at first Sari! <br></br>

            Aditya or as some of you might know him, Adit: unconventional in reel and real life, Aditya is constantly
            asking the question, “why?” Curious about overthrowing the norm and reassessing the how, Aditya is a natural
            born leader, an artist from birth, and a romantic at heart. Sure, he could’ve been a banker, a lawyer, a doctor,
            or followed his father into being an engineer. Little Aditya was a chubby kid with snoopy glasses and a mind
            filled with ideas and innovations, he didn’t draw attention to himself but he harbored this dream of giving
            others someone to relate to. By the time he graduated NYU, he’d worked at least 10 different industries within
            the corporate landscape to see where he would fit. But that insatiable curiosity lingered, and the need to tell
            stories and reflect the cultural zeitgeist was a light that wouldn’t blow out. Sure, he could’ve chosen an easier path,
            but then what are the chances he would’ve met beautiful B? <br></br>

            You see a girl like Brinda and you might think she’s an enigma. Equally deadly in silence and in laughter, B-ma
            has been obsessed with acting from a young age — never one for convention! For instance, at age 13, Brinda was
            commandeering her parents to mail her DIY headshot to all the top agencies in Los Angeles (still waiting to hear back,
            by the way!) At 15 years old, she met the (fall out) boy of her dreams Pete Wentz (lead singer of the band Fall Out Boy -
            but we can call them FOB for short) on set for their music video “I Don’t Care”. By the time she was 17, Brinda took the bold
            step to move to New York City on her own to pursue drama and the wonderful world of theatre - and she hasn’t looked back since!
            If there’s one thing anyone knows about Brinda, it’s her verve for life and her thirst for adventure - she’s always ready to give
            things a go and never says no to a good, or even questionable idea. With roots in Pachapur, Karnataka, a fluency in Spanish that puts
            Adit’s 4 years of study to shame, and a mastery of Bharatanatyam - it’s safe to say that wherever B goes next is sure to be a memorable watch! <br></br>

            <b>AB INFINITY</b><br></br>

            Look up in the sky! It’s a brand! It’s a hashtag! It’s…a way of life!<br></br>

            AB Infinity just sort of….happened: a conglomerate of the best parts of our two paramours, AB infinity is an emotion,
            a union, and a symbol of the future. It’s consistent yet ever expanding. At a time when love was at the back burner of
            their priorities, neither A or B was expecting their lives to change forever. Out of a collective and refreshing respect
            for one another’s work, life, and outlook was born a discovery of shared ambitions, and a safe haven to express their hopes
            and dreams, as well as their fears and restlessness. Today, AB Infinity presents a step into the unknown, side by side in
            strength, dancing with the ups and downs of life.<br></br>

            We are here to create a life that is positive, grounded and supportive of all of those near and dear to us. We hope to honor
            the traditions that have persuaded us to keep asking “why” in life, in love and in art. Most importantly, we are excited to
            share this wedding weekend with you. This is a special moment in time, and we want to honor YOU for being a part of our lives
            and contributing to the way we are today.<br></br>
